AIM: Demonstrate communication between two embedded devices using UART port

STEPS TO PERFORM THIS PRACTICAL:
1.Click on pick device icon and select the following

2.Now click on instruments and select virtual terminal.

3.Now connect Arduino and virtual terminal the topology will look like this

4.Now open Arduino idle and do the following: Click on file menu examples 
Basic DigitalReadSerial
It will open up the code

Now run this program
And in output it will give .hex file location copy that path
Note: if .hex path is not shown then click on file preferences and 
select the compile and upload checkboxes and click on ok and re run the code

5.Now in Proteus click on Arduino and in program files paste the .hex file-path

6.OUTPUT:
Now click on play button this will give u an 
output ie we are connecting two devices on UART port
