Aim: Deploy an IoT application which will alert you by beeping or vibrating your phone whenever you get someone call your name.

Theory:
Vibration can be defined as the mechanical oscillation about an 
equilibrium position of a machine or component or simply the back and 
forth motion of a machine or component.


Ground:

Grounding something simply means connecting it to ground. 
And in electronics, ground is just a name we give to a certain point in 
the circuit. For example, in a circuit with one battery 
(with a positive and a negative terminal), 
we usually refer to the negative terminal as ground.

Buzz:
The 8 Channel Quiz Buzzer Circuit using Microcontroller is a 
simple embedded system with a set of 8 push buttons being the input devices, 
a microcontroller as 
the main controller and the output devices being a buzzer and a display.

VCC:
VCC - The first choice for innovative, experiential learning for life. 
VCC is proud to inspire a new generation of students to discover their passions, 
gain essential skills, 
and learn what it takes to succeed in a competitive workforce

Vibration Sensor:

Vibration sensors are piezoelectric accelerometers that sense vibration. 
They are used for measuring fluctuating accelerations or speeds or for normal vibration measurement.
