Aim : -Develop an IoT application that will raise an alarm whenever with going to rain outside based on 
the weather prediction data

Components required:-
LCD, MCU board, humiture sensor

Theory: -
Humidity is the concentration of water vapour present in the air. 
Water vapor, the gaseous state of water, is generally invisible to the human eye. Humidity indicates the likelihood for precipitation, 
dew, or fog to be present. Humidity depends on the temperature and pressure of the system of interest.

Humidity value : - when the relative humidity is greater than about 70%. 
Rain. Often, rain will be falling from clouds where the humidity is 100% into air with a lower humidity. 
For example, it can rain at a ground humidity of 60%, but over time, the humidity will increase.


Steps:-
Take the components and arrange as shown in diagram

Code:

function getSensorData(){
return Math.floor(map(analogRead(A0), 0, 1023, 0, 100) + 0.5);
}

function setup() { attachInterrupt(A0, function() { processData(getSensorData());
});
}

function processData(data) { customWrite(0, data);
}
